Spring Boot E-Commerce project with WGU

This project is a full-stack e-commerce project using Spring Boot. I was given the opportunity to develop the back end of the full-stack which is provided in src file of this respiratory. The SQL database and front end was developed by Western Governors University and is not provided in my respiratory. However, I provided screenshots of the outcome of the full stack e-commerce.

In this project I was able to:

    Develop object-oriented applications that worked with the relational databases

    Develop a customer information input, cart, cartitems, order tracking

    Implement REST

    Create two validations: One for customer information, another for items placed in a cart.
